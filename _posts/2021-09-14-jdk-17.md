September 14th is the date, where the next LTS release of Java is available. So this is also the time, when the next migration phase will start .. so let's recap . What was your main issue when migratjng to JDK 11 ?
Mine is definitely the removal of JAXB-API. What do you think will be the main issue migrating to JDK 17 ?
